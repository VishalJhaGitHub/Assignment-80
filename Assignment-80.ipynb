The goal is to maximize the similarity within clusters and maximize the dissimilarity between different clusters.\n",

    "#1 - Customer segmentation: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior or preferences to target them with personalized marketing strategies.\n",

Preprocessing steps like data imputation or handling missing values should be carefully considered to ensure the reliability of the clustering outcomes."
